# General [Work in progress]

**Note:** This document is not final, feel free to suggest changes.

Many color schemes in the past had to deal with the lack of uniformity in the
scopes generated by syntax highlighters, manuals tried to list the common scopes
used throught the net but there were some inconsistencies and lack specificity.

Those issues would make it hard to have control over how the colors are applied
to specific tokens discoraging people to create color schemes that would work
across multiple programming languages.

This manual is an attemp to solve those problems by specifiying a pattern on what
and how scopes must be used in the syntax highlighting.

## Scope structure

Every token may have the following scopes:

* Origin (Optional)
* Context (Optional)
* Group (Optional)
* Identity (Required)

### Origin

Identifies the token’s origin to know if it's defined by a library or the
language’s core, for example:

```css
.support.core
.entity.name.function

.support.lib
.entity.name.constant
```

### Context

Some tokens may change based on the context, an example would be a function’s
parameter as they usualy just like normal variables and can be matched using
the same pattern.

```css
.parameter
.entity.name.variable
```

### Group

Grouping is commonly used to add special meaning to certain tokens. An common
example is that in some languages, class/function/variable declarations requires
a keyword before the actual entity’s name and most color schemes like to give
them a different color so that they are not confused with the other keywords:

#### Examples

```css
.storage.type
.keyword.declaration.function

.storage.type
.keyword.declaration.variable
```

### Identity

An identity is the most specific scope possible that decribes the token.

## Scope catalog

### Origin

```css
.support
  .core
  .lib
```

### Context

```css
.import
  .default

.function
  .parameter

.object
  .property
```

### Group

```css
.storage
  .modifier
  .type
```

### Identity

```css
.entity
  .name
    .class
    .interface
    .function
    .variable
    .constant
    .parameter
    .tag
    .attribute

.punctuation
  .delimiter
    .class
      .body
        .begin
        .end
    .function
      .arguments
      .body
        .begin
        .end
    .object
      .body
        .begin
        .end

.keyword
  .modifier
  .operator
    .assignment
    .logical
    .other
  .other
    .unit
```
