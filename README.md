This package was designed to provide a way to create maintainable and easy to
extend syntax highlighting. It does so by breaking the syntaxes into multiple
files and having lots of tests to assert the expected scenarios.

Color schemes are going to be provided not only to test the highlighting, but
to serve as a base to create new ones.

Right now, only PHP 7 is supported but other languages are going to be added as
soon as time allows it.

Feel free to send pull requests, any help will be highly appreciated.
