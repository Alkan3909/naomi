# Naomi

This package was designed to provide a way to create maintainable and easy to
extend syntax highlighting. It does so by breaking the syntaxes into multiple
files and having lots of tests to assert the expected scenarios.

Color schemes are going to be provided not only to test the highlighting, but
to serve as a base to create new ones.

Right now, only PHP 7 is supported but other languages are going to be added as
soon as time allows it. Feel free to send pull requests, any help will be highly
appreciated.

## Usage

After the package is installed, the PHP 7 syntax will be available under the
menu `View / Syntax / PHP 7`. You'll need to use a color scheme provided to see
the new syntax in action. It is available under the menu `Preferences / Color
Scheme / Naomi`.

If you don't like the color schemes provided, feel free to create your own and
send a pull request.
